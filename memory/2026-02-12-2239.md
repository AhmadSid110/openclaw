- Investigated Ahmad's "failed to collect usage" 500. The adapter apparently never writes synthesized usage to `ctx.run.state` or reports it, causing the accounting check to throw even though the Lightning API returns valid usage. Updated plan: immediately set `ctx.run.state.usage`, optionally call `ctx.run.reportUsage`, and include `usage` in the done payload before emitting the final event so OpenClaw can see it and stop failing.
