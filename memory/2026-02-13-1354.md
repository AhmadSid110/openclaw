🦞 OpenClaw 2026.2.12 (f9e444d) 🧠 Model: modal/zai-org/GLM-5-FP8 · 🔑 unknown 🧮 Tokens: 209k in / 354 out 📚 Context: 104k/400k (26%) · 🧹 Compactions: 0 🧵 Session: agent:main:main • updated just now ⚙️ Runtime: direct · Think: off 🪢 Queue: collect (depth 0) This is the main session
assistant: Got it — main session `agent:main:main` is the one you just listed: running `modal/zai-org/GLM-5-FP8`, ~209k in / 354 out, 104k/400k context, think/off, queue depth 0. Let me know what you want to do with it.

What is your endpoint what model are you
assistant: I’m running inside your OpenClaw gateway on `127.0.0.1:18789` (the loopback endpoint the controller exposes), and the current session’s default model is `modal/zai-org/GLM-5-FP8` (but OpenClaw will switch to other configured models if you direct it to). Let me know if you’d like to force a different provider or inspect a different endpoint.

Replied message (untrusted, for context):
```json
{
  "sender_label": "Sibyl",
  "body": "The GLM‑5‑FP8 entry we registered comes straight from the provider metadata, and it declares a 2 048‑token context window/response limit (see ~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/models.json lines 92‑113). Until Modal advertises a larger window for that specific model in their catalog (and the gateway reloads the catalog), OpenClaw will enforce the 2 048 limit to keep requests valid. If there’s a different “GLM‑5” tier with ~200 K tokens exposed by Modal, we’d need the provider to publish that variant under a separate model ID and update the catalog (or add a custom entry with those capabilities) before OpenClaw can use it. Source: /home/ubuntu/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/models.json#92-113"
}
```

this exact model + stack (zai-org/GLM-5-FP8 on Modal + SGLang): ✅ Max tokens (clear numbers) Maximum context window (input + output combined) 👉 128,000 tokens This is the hard model limit. FP8 does not reduce it. Maximum output tokens (generation) 👉 No fixed hard cap at the model level Practically: Max output = 128k − input tokens Controlled by: max_tokens in the request (you set None ✅) max_model_len / output limits in config.yaml If you don’t explicitly cap output, SGLang will generate until it hits the context limit or an internal stop condition.
assistant: OpenClaw knows about `modal/zai-org/GLM-5-FP8` via the provider catalog in `~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/models.json`. That entry currently hard-codes `"contextWindow": 2048` and `"maxTokens": 2048`, so the gateway enforces that cap (see lines 92‑113 of that file). If the Modal docs you quoted are correct about a full 128k window/output, the gateway’s metadata needs to be updated to match: either refresh the provider catalog (if Modal publishes an updated model description) or edit the JSON entry yourself to reflect the larger limits and restart the gateway so it stops blocking larger requests.

Change it now
assistant: Updated the `modal/zai-org/GLM-5-FP8` entry in `~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/models.json` so both `contextWindow` and `maxTokens` now read 128 000 (matching the data from Modal’s docs). You’ll need to restart the OpenClaw gateway (e.g., `openclaw gateway restart` or the equivalent service restart) so the new limits take effect; let me know if you’d like me to do that.

Restart gateway
user: Pre-compaction memory flush. Store durable memories now (use memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md; create memory/ if needed). IMPORTANT: If the file already exists, APPEND new content only and do not overwrite existing entries. If nothing to store, reply with NO_REPLY.
