assistant: Hey Ahmad, Sibyl here – running on openai‑gpt5/openai‑gpt‑oss‑120b (my default is google‑gemini‑cli/gemini‑3‑pro‑preview). What would you like me to do?
user: [Telegram Ahmad (@Theoneaboveall1) id:5379669947 +11s Fri 2026-02-13 02:25 UTC] Root cause: OpenClaw’s Lightning adapter was never writing the synthesized usage back into the agent run state before the final done event, so the accounting layer kept throwing Error("failed to collect usage") (see the earlier memory log where you highlighted the exact ctx.run.state.usage = synthesizedUsage/ctx.run.reportUsage requirement). The model completes fine, but OpenClaw aborts with HTTP 500 because it never sees non‑zero usage tied to the run. Fix: patch the Lightning provider adapter so that, after computing synthesizedUsage, we immediately write it into the run state and (if available) call ctx.run.reportUsage(usage) before emitting the final event. The final payload must also include that usage block for OpenClaw’s “done” handler. The change looks like: const usage = { prompt_tokens: pt, completion_tokens: ct, total_tokens: pt + ct, estimated: true }; ctx.run.state.usage = usage; ctx.run.reportUsage?.(usage); emitDone({ ...finalResponse, usage }); Once that change is in place and the gateway restarted, the Lightning model stops hitting the “failed to collect usage” check, so the 500s go away. Do this
