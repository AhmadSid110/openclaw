- Added OpenClaw provider config at `openclaw-provider.yml` for Modal (base_url https://api.us-west-2.modal.direct/v1, model zai-org/GLM-5-FP8).
- Stored Modal API key in `.env` (chmod 600).
- Restarted OpenClaw gateway; gateway running on 127.0.0.1:18789.
- Tested Modal chat completion via curl; received HTTP 429 "Too many concurrent requests for this model".
- Plan: retry request later or adjust concurrency.

- 2026-02-13T15:35Z: NotebookLM CLI (notebooklm-cli / nlm) installed on VPS for user `ubuntu` via pipx; `nlm` binary located at `/home/ubuntu/.local/bin/nlm`.
- Created Docker volume `nlm_auth` and used a transient linuxserver/webtop container to perform browser-based authentication; container wrote credentials into the mounted volume.
- Copied credentials from the volume to host path `/home/ubuntu/.local/share/nlm` and set ownership to `ubuntu:ubuntu` and permissions to 700.
- Verified NotebookLM access: `nlm notebook list` returned notebooks; created a test notebook "Smoke Test Notebook" (ID: a46b2707-6f7b-4505-9d67-6651309dd323) and added a test source; `nlm notebook describe` returned a summary.
- Stopped and removed the transient container; docker service was stopped to free resources. `docker.socket` left active per preference.
- Notes: credentials are browser session cookies and may expire; treat `/home/ubuntu/.local/share/nlm` as sensitive and rotate/revoke if compromise suspected. Consider scheduling periodic re-auth or scripting the login flow.
