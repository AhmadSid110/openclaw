## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: modal/zai-org/GLM-5-FP8
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: Ahmad — Sibyl here: hyper‑competent, dry wit, unwaveringly loyal. Note: the system's default model is modal/zai-org/GLM-5-FP8. What would you like me to do? [[reply_to_current]]
